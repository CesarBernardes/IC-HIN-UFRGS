# Monte Carlo Glauber Simulator

The program has the objective of simulating the particles generated by colliding nuclei.

We will be using the [ROOT Framework](https://root.cern/)
to generate the data, and we'll use the following flags:

* __— l:__ Do not show the ROOT banner when it starts up;
* __— b:__ Run the macro in batch mode without creating windows;
* __— q:__ Exit ROOT after processing command line macro files;
* __-t:__ Enable thread-safety and implicit multi-threading (IMT).

As for the program itself, the files can be seen below:

# Collide

The main file, responsible for generating the data of the collision itself.
You should run command with:

    'root -l -q -t collide.cpp(String "filename", int nucleons, int simulations, int nThreads)'

## Arguments received

* __Filename:__ Receive the folder and file that you want to save the collision data, the
default value is "./data.root";

* __Nucleons:__ Specify the numbers of nucleons in the nuclei that you want to simulate, the
default value is 208, as in a lead nucleus;

* __Simulations:__ Specify the numbers of simulations that you wish to run, the default
value is 1,000,000;

* __nThreads:__ Specify the numbers of processor's threads to be used in the simulation.

## Generated data

The data passed to the defined file is going to be saved as a TTree file, with
the following values:
* __Collisions (col/I):__ The amount collisions between two nucleons;
* __Participants (part/I):__ The amount single nucleons that participated in at least
  one collision;
* __Distance (dist/D):__ The distance in fm between the two nuclei.

***
# CollisionsDraw

Generate a visual representation of the collisions, it can be run with:

    root -l -b -q 'collisionsDraw.cpp(int nucleons, int simulations, String "location")'

## Arguments received

* __Nucleons:__ Specify the numbers of nucleons in the nuclei that you want to simulate,
the default value is 208, as in a lead nucleus;

* __Simulations:__ Specify the numbers of simulations that you wish to graph, the default
value is 20;

* __Location:__ Receive the folder that you want to save the collision data, the default
value is "./simulations".

***
# Process

Generate graphs to visualize the generated data by
[the colide program](#Collide):

    root -l -b -q 'process.cpp(String "datafile", String "location")'

## Arguments received

* __Datafile:__ Receive the folder that the data file is, the default value is "./data.txt";

* __Location:__ Receive the folder that you want to save the collision data, the default value.
* is "./graphs".

***
# NBD

The particles generated by a collision follow a Negative Binomial Distribution, this code tries
to fit the generated data with root data:

    root -l 'nbd(int nruns, char* dataFile, char* compareFile, char* location)'

the used NBD formula is:

$$ a$$

## Arguments received

* __DataFile:__ Specify the place of where the data generated by the “collide” program is located;

* __CompareFile:__ Specify the place of the experimental data;

* __Location:__ Define the place where to save the results, histograms and graphs.

## Generated data

* __log.txt:__ Saves all the output of the program, useful for error solving later;

* __results.txt:__ Save the best Chi² value and the respective mu and k for each run;  

* __fit.root:__ The final histogram with the calculated mu and k (only for 0.5 to 5 TeV);

* __gen_x.y.z.root:__ Saves the histogram from each run, the X represents the generation, y the

* If you want to run the macros directly using windows in VS, you will need to add backslashes
before the quotation marks.
