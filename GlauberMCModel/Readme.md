# Monte Carlo Glauber Simulator

This program has the objective of simulate the particles generated by colliding nuclei.

We will be using the [ROOT Framework](https://root.cern/)
to generate the data, and we'll use the following flags:

* __-l:__ Do not show the ROOT banner when it starts up;
* __-b:__ Run the macro in batch mode without creating windows;
* __-q:__ Exit ROOT after processing command line macro files;
* __-t:__ Enable thread-safety and implicit multi-threading (IMT).

As for the program itself, the files are:

# Collide

This is the main file, responsible for generating the data  of the collision itself. You are
advised run command with:

    'root -l -q -t collide.cpp(String "filename", int nucleons, int simulations, int nThreads)'

## Arguments received

* __Filename:__ Receive the folder and file that you want to save the  collision data, the
default value is "./data.root";

* __Nucleons:__ Specify the numbers of nucleons in the nuclei that you want to simulate, the
default value is 208, as in a lead nucleus;

* __Simulations:__ Specify the numbers of simulations that you wish to run, the default
value is 1,000,000;

* __nThreads:__ Specify the numbers of processor's threads to be used in the simulation.

## Generated data

The data passed to the defined file is going to be saved as a TTree file, with
the following values:
* __Collisions (col/I):__ The number of collisions between two nucleons;
* __Participants (part/I):__ The number of single nucleons that participated of at least
  one collision;
* __Distance (dist/D):__  The distance in fm between the two nuclei.

***
# CollisionsDraw

Generate a visual representation of the collisions, it can be run with:

    root -l -b -q 'collisionsDraw.cpp(int nucleons, int simulations, String "location")'

## Arguments received

* __Nucleons:__ Specify the numbers of nucleons in the nuclei that you  want to simulate,
the default value is 208, as in a lead nucleus;

* __Simulations:__ Specify the numbers of simulations that you wish to  graph, the default
value is 20;

* __Location:__ Receive the folder that you want to save the collision data, the default
value is "./simulations".

***
# Process

Generate graphs to visualize the generated data by
[the colide program](#Collide):

    root -l -b -q 'process.cpp(String "datafile", String "location")'

## Arguments received

* __Datafile:__ Receive the folder that the data file is , the default value is "./data.txt";

* __Location:__ Receive the folder that you want to save the collision data, the default value
* is "./graphs".

***
# NegativeBinomialDist

The collision generate particles following a Negative Binomial Distribution, this code tries
to fit the generated data with root data:

    root -l 'negativeBinomialDist (char* dataFile, char* compareFile, char* parameterGraph)'

## Arguments received

* __DataFile:__ Specify the place of where the data generated by the collide program is;

* __CompareFile:__ Specify the place of the experimental data.

* __ParameterGraph:__ Define the place where to save the generated parameters 

***

# Notes

* If you want to run the macros directly using windows in VS, you will need to add backslashes
before the quotation marks.

* The NegativeBinomialDist program is currently not working as intended
